Schenectady Government 1: Hey, somehow our budget this year allowed for GPS's in our dump trucks, and i have absolutely no idea what to do with this shit.
Schenectady Government 2: Hmmm, maybe the community college has someone with an idea that we can justify this purchase to our bosses.
Schenectady Government 1: But there's a problem here. Our entire department only has a budget of $5000.
Schenectady Community College: I love this idea. One minor issue, we don't have anyone who wants to do anything like this.
Schenectady Government 1: How about you get people from the surrounding area to do it instead?
Schenectady Community College: Hm, we haven't really been relevant recently, so we could definitely use a project to attempt to bring people from other universities over here.
		But how can we get people to participate?
Schenectady Government 2: I've heard there are a lot of fucking nerds in this area, maybe we can appeal to that somehow.
Schenectady Community College: Well we've always wanted to run a hackathon, and we can really use something like this.
Schenectady Government 1: But does anyone really want to create a project solely dedicated to garbage trucks?
Schenectady Community College: Maybe if we don't tell anyone beforehand, it'll be too inconvenient to leave, and they'll have nothing better to do.
Transfinder: You know, this is a pretty great idea. So how many times can you mention transfinder in this competition?
Uptime: You know, we're doing market research, and if we could keep people energetic during literally the least interesting task possible, clearly our product has some merit.
